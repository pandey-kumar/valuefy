*Requirements for Streamlit Voice-to-Text Application*

*1. Functionality:*

* *Voice Recording:*
    * The application must provide a button or user interface element to initiate voice recording.
    * Upon activation, the application should capture audio input from the user's microphone.
    * The application should visually indicate when it is actively recording (e.g., "Listening...").
* *Speech Recognition:*
    * The application must convert the captured audio into text.
    * The application should utilize a speech recognition library or API (e.g., Google Web Speech API via SpeechRecognition library).
    * The recognized text must be displayed to the user.
* *Error Handling:*
    * The application must handle cases where audio cannot be understood (e.g., sr.UnknownValueError).
    * The application must handle cases where the speech recognition service is unavailable or encounters an error (e.g., sr.RequestError).
    * Error messages must be clearly displayed to the user.
* *User Interface (UI):*
    * The application must be built using Streamlit.
    * The UI should be intuitive and easy to use.
    * The application should display a title (e.g., "Voice to Text").
    * The option to start recording should be a clear button.
    * The recognized text should be displayed in a readable format.
    * Error messages should be clearly visible.
* *Optional Features:*
    * Language selection for speech recognition.
    * Displaying a visual representation of the audio waveform.
    * Saving the recognized text to a file.
    * The ability to change the background to black.

*2. Technical Requirements:*

* *Programming Language:* Python
* *Libraries:*
    * Streamlit
    * SpeechRecognition
* *Speech Recognition API:*
    * Google Web Speech API (via SpeechRecognition) or an alternative.
* *Operating System:* Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* *Internet Connection:* Required for Google Web Speech API.
* *Microphone Access:* User must grant microphone access to the application.

*3. Non-Functional Requirements:*

* *Performance:*
    * Speech recognition should be performed with minimal latency.
* *Usability:*
    * The application should be easy to use for users with varying technical skills.
* *Reliability:*
    * The application should handle errors gracefully and provide informative messages.
* *Security:*
    * If using an API that requires keys, keys should be storedÂ securely.
